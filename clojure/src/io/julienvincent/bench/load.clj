(defmacro burn
  "Run a given function `f` with various constraints and calculate its performance.
  
   This is primarilly intended for load-testing external systems in a programmable way. This
   is **not** designed to benchmark clojure functions accurately - there are better tools
   for this (like criterium or JMH).
  
   This can be thought of more as programatic replacement to http loading tools like `hey`.
  
   This is useful when you want to have more complex load-generating scenarios, such as
   generating special data for each run.
  
   Accepts a few options:

   - `:concurrency` - Default: `1`. How many threads to spawn which concurrently call `f`
   - `:samples` - Default `nil`. How many times to call `f`. Total. Mutually exclusive with
                                 `:duration-ms`.
   - `:duration-ms` - Default `10000`. A duration in ms to execute `f`. Once duration is reached
                                       all threads will be shutdown. Mutually exclusive with
                                       `:samples`.
   - `:warmup-samples` - Default `nil`. Number of times to call `f` during warm-up phase. No metrics
                                        will be calculated during warm-up. Mutually exclusive with
                                        `:warmup-duration-ms`
   - `:warmup-duration-ms` - Default `nil`. Duration in ms to run the warm-up phase. Threads will be
                                            shutdown once this is reached. Mutually exclusive with
                                            `:warmup-samples`.

   ## Examples

   ```clojure
   (burn {:concurrency 10 :samples 100}
     (http/request client \"/some/path\"))

   (burn {:duration-ms 30000 :warmup-duration-ms 1000}
     (http/request client \"/some/path\"))

   (burn {:concurrency 10 :samples 1000 :warmup-samples 100}
     (http/request client \"/some/path\"))
   ```

   Reports results as a histogram, ops/s, total runtime, mean, max
