# Repository Guidelines

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Prefer snake_case for variable names across languages, including JS/TS, UNLESS the language supports kebab-case! If
  kebab-case is available (like for Clojure), then prefer that.
- JS/TS: use camelCase for function names; variables remain snake_case.
- Lua: use snake_case for everything (functions, variables, modules).
- Markdown: wrap prose at 90 characters text width.

## Comments

- Do not insert unnecessary comments.
- Only add comments that explain non-obvious behavior or provide relevant context.
