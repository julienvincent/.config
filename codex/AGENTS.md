# Repository Guidelines

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Prefer snake_case for variable names across languages, including JS/TS.
- JS/TS: use camelCase for function names; variables remain snake_case.
- Lua: use snake_case for everything (functions, variables, modules).
- Markdown: wrap prose at 90 characters text width.

## Comments
- Do not insert unnecessary comments.
- Only add comments that explain non-obvious behavior or provide relevant context.
